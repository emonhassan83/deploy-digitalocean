# Adding Free SSL with Certbot and Nginx

This guide outlines the steps to install a free SSL certificate using Certbot and Let's Encrypt on an Nginx server.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-based server (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian)
- Nginx installed and configured
- A domain name pointed to your server's IP address
- SSH access to your server

## Step 1: Install Certbot and Nginx Plugin

First, update your package list and install Certbot along with the Nginx plugin.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

## Step 2: Obtain an SSL Certificate

Use Certbot to automatically obtain and install the SSL certificate for your domain. Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
```

During the process, Certbot will:
1. Ask for your email address for renewal reminders.
2. Request agreement to the terms of service.
3. Optionally ask if you want to share your email with the EFF for updates.

Certbot will then communicate with Let's Encrypt to validate your domain and obtain the SSL certificate.

## Step 4: Test Nginx Configuration and Reload

Test your Nginx configuration for syntax errors and reload the service to apply the changes.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Step 5: Ensure Automatic Renewal

Certbot includes a systemd timer for automatic certificate renewal. You can test the renewal process with:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

This command simulates the renewal process to ensure it will work smoothly.

## Conclusion

Your Nginx server should now serve your website over HTTPS using a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
